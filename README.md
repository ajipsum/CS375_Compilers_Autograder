# Instructions for autograding

## Project 1 Lexical Analyzer

1. Make sure students submit the right files. Unzip any zipped files.
2. run `./prepare.sh p1`
   Note that prepare.sh also does the unzipping and renaming.
3. run `./lexer_autograder.sh p1` for all students
4. run `./lexer_autograder.sh p1 studentDir` for a single student

## Project 2 Lexer

Same as project 1 except p1 should be replaced with p2.

## Project 3 Parsing trivb.pas

1. `./prepare.sh p3`
2. `./parser_autograder.sh p3` to grade all students.
3. Or `./parser_autograder.sh p3 studentDir` to grade a single student.

## Project 4 Parsing graph1.pas (graph1i.pas)

Same as project 3 except p3 should be replaced with p4.

Note that the c++ symbol table checker is in the symTable dir.
The autograder will compile the checker before grading. 

## Project 5 Parsing pasrec.pas and graph1i.pas

Same as project 3 except p3 should be replaced with p5
