# Grading Guideline for Project 5 --- parsing pasrec.pas and graph1i.pas

**Your code will be checked for plagiarism against each other as well as some online github code using moss. If you get caught, you will get a 0 for this project.**

## Rubrics

The grading of this project is divided into the following two parts:

1. `pasrec.pas` ==> 90 points.
    There are 13 unit tests in the `test_p5` directory. 
    Each test is extracted from `pasrec.pas` (or something similar) and focuses on 
    one part of it. 
    The points of each unit test is detailed in the below table.
    You can get partial points if only part of the result is correct. 
    The samples are in the `sample_p5` directory. 
    
| Test No. | Points | Content                                |
| -------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 0        | 8      | instrec                                |
| 0        | 4      | instenum                               |
| 0        | 5      | instpoint                              |
| 0        | 8      | instarray                              |
| 1        | 4      | while loop                             |
| 2        | 4      | label/goto                             |
| 3        | 5      | write and writeln in makefuncall       |
| 4        | 5      | new() in makefuncall+size of record    |
| 5        | 8      | simple reducedot                       |
| 6        | 6      | dopoint->reducedot                     |
| 7        | 4      | dopoint->reducedot->reducedot          |
| 8        | 4      | dopoint->reducedot->dopoint->reducedot |
| 9        | 5      | arrayref-1D-constantIdx->reducedot     |
| 10       | 6      | arrayref-1D-varIdx->reducedot          |
| 11       | 6      | arrayref-2D-constantIdx-constantIdx    |
| 12       | 8      | arrayref-2D-varIdx-constantIdx         |
| Total    | 90     | | 
2. `graph1i.pas` ==> 10 points. Please make sure your new parser can still handle it.
    The [rubrics of project 4](https://github.com/zhanglx13/CS375_Compilers_Autograder/blob/master/rubrics/p3.md#Rubrics) will be used except the total points are scaled to 10.

## Submissions

- parse.y (for Yacc) or parsc.c (for C)
- lexan.l (If not found, the one from project 2 will be used)
- Any other files that you have modified.

## Autograding

Same as [project 3](https://github.com/zhanglx13/CS375_Compilers_Autograder/blob/master/rubrics/p3.md#Autograding)
except that the command for running the autograder should be 
```
./grade.sh -p 5 -d workingDir
```
You should make sure that `graph1i.pas` is in your workingDir.

**Remember to copy `printtoken.c`, `pprint.c`, and `print.h` from `cs375_minimal`
directory into your workingdir before running the autograder.**

## Notes

Make sure you read the [notes of project 3](https://github.com/zhanglx13/CS375_Compilers_Autograder/blob/master/rubrics/p3.md#Notes)
and the [notes of project 4](https://github.com/zhanglx13/CS375_Compilers_Autograder/blob/master/rubrics/p4.md#Notes)

Here are some more notes for this project

### Make sure you initialize everything before using it

Let's say you are trying to reduce `ac[7].re`. 
After you figure out that `ac[7]` is a complex, you probably need to go through 
its field list to locate `re` using an index `i`. 
If you messed up with `ac[7]`, which means the pointers of the `recordsym` is 
not properly set, you will not find `re` in the field list. 
However, if you do not initialize `i`, its value could be set to 0 by some compiler. 
In this case, it seems to you that the 0th field matches `re` and you happen 
to get the correct result.

### Make sure you set the type of `aref` properly

When you do type coercion for 
```
john^.location.re := 3;
```
The lhs will be converted to 
```
(aref (^ john) 16)
```
Then the correctness of type coercion will depend on the type of aref.
In general, if `aref` refers to a complex type, such as RECORD, POINTER, the 
**symtype** field of `aref` should be properly set. If `aref` refers to a basic 
type, such as real and integer, the **basicdt** field of `aref` should also be 
properly set. 

For the next project --- codegen, if the type of `aref` is not properly set, 
the wrong register might be chosen for the `aref` structure. So make sure 
you get this right.
