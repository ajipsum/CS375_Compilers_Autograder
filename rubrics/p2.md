# Grading Guideline for Project 2 --- Lex

## Rubrics

- total points: 100
- -1 for any incorrectly processed token each.

## Submission

Submit `lexan.l` and/or any other files you have modified.

## Testing

Your code will be tested by two files: `scantst.pas` and `graph1.pas`.
The sample output files are `scantst.lexer` and `graph1.lexer`.
You can run your lexer as follows
```
make lexer
./lexer < scantst.pas # This will print the output to the stdout
./lexer < scantst.pas > scantst.output # This will save the output into scantst.output
```
Then you can compare the outputs using `diff` or any online diff checkers.

## Autograding

Remember to update the autograder repo before using it for this project.

Everything is the same as [project 1](https://github.com/zhanglx13/CS375_Compilers_Autograder/blob/master/rubrics/p1.md#Autograding)
except the following command should be used
to run the autograder:
```
./grade.sh -p 2 -d workingDir
```

**The autograder uses clang to compile your parser and runs on the cs machine, which uses flex 2.6.4**
To use `clang` to compile your parser, you can also copy `makefile` in `/cs375_minimal/`
into your working dir. 
This `makefile` is a compact version of the original `makefile` provided in the `cs375`
directory.


# Notes

- For comments, check `commentsinlex.txt` for an easy way to do it.
You can also write regular expressions for comments, though this method is not 
trivial.
